- Adaptation to multiple APK outputs introduced in the Android Gradle plugin 0.13.x.
This plugin does not use deprecated methods. Yet, be warned, density/abi splits are not really supported.
- Spoon runner dependency bump. This makes it possible to use the plugin with Android plugin 0.14.x.
- Support library projects.
